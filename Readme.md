# Dynamic Connect-3


### Project 12 - AI course (ECSE 526) - McGill - Fall 2016
Check project instuctions [here](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~jer/courses/ai/as2).

The objective is to:
- Develop Markov and hidden Markov models for English text.
- Apply it to generate sentences according to the provided vocabulary and conditional probabilities 
- Then sentence correction using HMM is performed. 

Python (2.7) was used to complete this assignment.
In part 1, conditional probability distributions provided in *gram_counts.txt* files were used to generate Markov chains, or sentences.
In part 2, the first-order hidden Markov model was used to model the joint probability (bigram distribution).
